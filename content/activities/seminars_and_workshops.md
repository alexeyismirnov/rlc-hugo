INFORMATIVE MEETING: STUDY IN RUSSIA

Moscow | St-Petersburg | Vladivostok | Petrozavodsk | Yaroslavl | Novosibirsk | Omsk

We will introduce the cities, schools and programs to you and will help to organise your study there. At the end of the meeting we will offer you a typical standard test to see your approximate level of Russian language proficiency.
