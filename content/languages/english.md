English for beginners (10-week course)

Instructor: _Irina Ustyugova_

We have been asked on multiple occasions to organise the courses for grown-up Russian speakers who would like to refresh their knowledge of English. If you studied English at school, if you forgot a better part of it but would like to communicate, we will  be glad to see you in a group.

Your instructor  Irina will help you not only to understand what is being said but also to break the psychological barrier.
